# Protein Sequence Length and Signal Peptide Analysis

This repository includes the notebook **`plots.ipynb`**, designed to explore and visualize key characteristics of protein sequences in both **training** and **benchmarking** datasets.  
The analyses cover aspects such as **protein length**, **signal peptide (SP) features**, **amino acid composition**, **taxonomic origin**, and **SP cleavage site motifs**.

## üîç Objectives of the Analysis

This analysis aims to:

- Identify potential **dataset biases** (e.g., in length, amino acid composition, or taxonomy).  
- Evaluate whether sequence-derived features are **informative for classification tasks**.  
- Gain **biological insights** into signal peptide properties.  
- Compare and **highlight differences** between training and benchmarking datasets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn logomaker
