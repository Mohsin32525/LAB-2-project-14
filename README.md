## Data Collection


 It focuses on preparing and analyzing protein datasets retrieved from UniProt.

Positive Protein Set


Number of proteins: 2,949

Selection criteria: Proteins were retrieved from UniProt using the following filters:
```bash
existence level = 1, length â‰¥ 40 amino acids, reviewed entries, taxonomy ID = 2759, non-fragmented, and containing annotated signal peptides.(existence:1) AND (length:[40 TO ]) AND (reviewed:true) AND (taxonomy_id:2759) AND (fragment:false) AND (ft_signal_exp:)
```

API Endpoint:
https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?format=json&query=%28%28existence%3A1%29+AND+%28taxonomy_id%3A2759%29+AND+%28ft_signal_exp%3A*%29+AND+%28length%3A%5B40+TO+*%5D%29+AND+%28reviewed%3Atrue%29+AND+%28fragment%3Afalse%29%29&size=500

Negative Protein Set

Number of proteins: 20,615

Selection criteria: Proteins without annotated signal peptides but meeting other quality criteria:
```bash
existence = 1, length â‰¥ 40, reviewed, taxonomy ID = 2759, and non-fragmented.(existence:1) AND (length:[40 TO ]) AND (reviewed:true) AND (taxonomy_id:2759) AND (fragment:false) NOT (ft_signal:) AND ((cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0091) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0191) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0173) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0209) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0204) OR (cc_scl_term_exp:SL-0039))

```

API Endpoint:
https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?format=json&query=%28%28fragment%3Afalse%29+AND+%28reviewed%3Atrue%29+AND+%28existence%3A1%29+AND+%28taxonomy_id%3A2759%29+AND+%28length%3A%5B40+TO+*%5D%29+AND+NOT+%28ft_signal%3A*%29+AND+%28cc_scl_term_exp%3ASL-0091+OR+cc_scl_term_exp%3ASL-0191+OR+cc_scl_term_exp%3ASL-0173+OR+cc_scl_term_exp%3ASL-0209+OR+cc_scl_term_exp%3ASL-0204+OR+cc_scl_term_exp%3ASL-0039%29%29&size=500

Notes: This endpoint also returns results in chunks of 500 and requires pagination.


## 2. API-Based Data Retrieval

Two scripts were developed to automate dataset construction via the UniProt API:

- [get_dataset_pos.ipynb](get_dataset_pos.ipynb) â†’ retrieves the **positive set**  
- [get_dataset_neg.ipynb](get_dataset_neg.ipynb) â†’ retrieves the **negative set**  

Each script performs the API queries, outputs results in both **.tsv** and **.fasta** formats, and applies filtering rules:

- **Positive set**: sequences are retained only if they contain a signal peptide of at least 14 amino acids and a defined cleavage site.  
- **Negative set**: sequences are kept only if they contain a transmembrane helix within the first 90 residues.  


3. Data Collection Output

The retrieved datasets were stored in two complementary formats:

.tsv files â†’ contain protein metadata.

Positive set: UniProt accession, organism name, kingdom, sequence length, signal peptide cleavage site position.

Negative set: UniProt accession, organism name, kingdom, sequence length, and presence/absence of a transmembrane helix in the first 90 residues.

.fasta files â†’ contain the corresponding protein sequences.

### Summary of Retrieved Proteins

| Dataset              | Count  |
|----------------------|--------|
| Positive Set         | 2,932  |
| Negative Set         | 20,615 |
| Negatives with Helix | 1,384  |

## Data Preparation
# ðŸ§¬ Reducing Data Redundancy and Preparing Datasets

Prepare clean datasets for machine learning by removing redundancy and selecting representative sequences.

## Steps

1. **Cluster sequences** using MMSeqs2 to remove similar sequences.  
2. **Select representatives** with `filter_representatives.py`.  
3. **Split data** into 80% training and 20% testing (`split_train_test.py`).  
4. **Create 5-fold cross-validation** sets (`make_crossval_folds.py`).  
5. **Verify** results using `wc -l` and `uniq -c`.

## Output

- Non-redundant FASTA and filtered metadata files.  
- Training/test splits and fold assignments.

 Result: Clean, balanced, reproducible datasets for ML.



Project Overview

The repository provides a foundation for protein sequence analysis, useful for tasks such as signal peptide prediction, dataset preparation, or other bioinformatics workflows. All codes are implemented in Python.
